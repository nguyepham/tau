/**
 * Team-mode orchestrator prompt.
 *
 * Composes the addendum injected into the main session's system prompt when
 * /team-mode is ON. The string is purely a function of the active roster, so
 * within a stable session it's bit-identical across turns: the provider
 * prompt cache stays warm.
 *
 * Returns null when:
 *   - team-mode is OFF, OR
 *   - the roster has no active roles to spawn
 *
 * In both cases the system prompt is byte-identical to its pre-team-mode form.
 * That's the cache-preservation contract: normal mode pays nothing.
