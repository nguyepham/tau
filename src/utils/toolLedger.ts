/**
 * In-session tool ledger and thrash detection.
 *
 * The classic waste pattern: the model runs the same tool with the same input,
 * it fails, and the model runs it again verbatim: three, five, ten times:
 * until the turn budget or the user's patience runs out. Nothing in the loop
 * notices, because each individual call is a legitimate tool use that was
 * permitted and executed.
 *
 * This module derives a ledger of tool calls from the message history and
 * reports that pattern. Two deliberate properties:
 *
 *   - Derived, not tracked. There is no hook to register and no mutable global
 *     to keep in sync with the conversation; compaction, rewind, and forks all
 *     produce a correct ledger for free because the ledger IS the history.
 *   - Read-only. Detection never mutates messages and never reaches the wire,
 *     so it cannot perturb the prompt cache. The caller decides whether to act.
 *
 * Leaf module (only `djb2Hash`), so the checks in toolLedger.test.ts run
 * standalone.
