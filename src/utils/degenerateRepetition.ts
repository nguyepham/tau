/**
 * Degenerate output-loop detection.
 *
 * A model that loses the thread sometimes stops generating and starts
 * *looping*: the same sentence or paragraph emitted over and over until the
 * output-token ceiling finally stops it. Weak and heavily quantized models on
 * compat lanes do it most, usually after a tool returns nothing useful and
 * they have nothing left to say. Nothing in the streaming protocol catches it
 *: `stop_reason` only arrives at the end, so a stream that has degenerated
 * looks exactly like a stream that is working, and the turn burns output
 * tokens until the ceiling is hit.
 *
 * This module finds the pattern in accumulated text so the caller can cut the
 * stream off. Two deliberate properties:
 *
 *   - Leaf module. No imports, no I/O, no env reads (thresholds are passed
 *     in), so degenerateRepetition.test.ts runs standalone.
 *   - Exact-match only. Detection is exact periodicity at the *tail* of the
 *     text, which is what a decoding loop actually produces. Near-repeats
 *     ("1. foo / 2. foo") are not flagged: a fuzzy matcher would eventually
 *     truncate legitimate structured output, and a false positive here
 *     silently cuts a real answer short.
