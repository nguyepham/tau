 *   starts. Only the core file/shell/search/task tools remain.
 * - `normal`: current default behavior. The user's own /tools toggles apply,
 *   MCP/skills/agents/plugins/LSP load as configured.
 * - `full`: everything on. All optional prebuilt tool toggles are forced on
 *   regardless of saved /tools state; MCP/skills/agents/LSP behave as in
 *   normal mode.
 *
 * The mode is a persisted user setting (settings.json `powerMode`). All gates
 * read it through the merged settings so a /mode switch (which persists and
 * resets the settings cache) takes effect immediately and deterministically:
 * within a mode the tool list is stable, so prompt caching is unaffected
 * except for the single expected re-warm when the user changes modes.

 * and Tau's settings file-watcher (utils/settings/changeDetector.ts) applies
 * external edits to that file LIVE. Without a pin, a second concurrently
 * running Tau session that runs `/mode` writes powerMode to the shared file,
 * this session's watcher fires, resetSettingsCache() + applySettingsChange()
 * run, and this session silently switches mode mid-conversation: the
 * cross-session leak users hit ("switch mode in session B, session A inherits
 * it"). The pin makes each session's mode sticky: seeded once at startup from
 * the persisted value, changed ONLY by this session's own /mode. Persisting to
 * disk still happens (so the last writer sets the default for the NEXT launch),
 * but a live external write can no longer move a running session.
 *
 * null = not yet seeded; getPowerModeFromSettings falls back to the passed
 * settings (its original pure behavior, which keeps unit tests deterministic).
