/**
 * Concurrency gate for subagents on the Antigravity Gemini path.
 *
 * Antigravity's Gemini implicit cache holds ~one prefix slot per account
 * with a multi-second async write commit. Fully-parallel agent streams land
 * inside each other's commit windows and evict each other (a parallel
 * 3-agent batch measured 0/17 agent cache hits and forced the parent into
 * repeated full-context re-ingests, ~4x session cost). Strict serialization
 * fixed the cache but serialized the wall clock with it.
 *
 * OFF by default: the gate only earns its keep alongside the prefix pad
 * (TAU_ANTIGRAVITY_MAX_CACHE), which makes agents large enough to contend
 * for the one cache slot. With the pad off, small agents don't cache anyway,
 * so serializing them would only cost wall-clock: agents run fully parallel.
 *
 * When MAX_CACHE is on, the gate is a small concurrency window (default 2)
 * rather than strict serialization: most fan-outs are 2-3 wide, so width 2
 * roughly halves wall-clock while still capping cache-slot contention. Tune
 * with TAU_ANTIGRAVITY_AGENT_CONCURRENCY (1 = strict serial / maximal cache
 * hits; higher = faster / more thrash). TAU_ANTIGRAVITY_PARALLEL_AGENTS=1
 * force-removes the gate even under MAX_CACHE.
 *
 * Gemini-only: Claude resold through Antigravity uses a multi-entry,
 * low-minimum content-addressed cache that does not thrash under parallel
 * spawns, so it is never gated. Every other provider is untouched.
