/**
 * Session-level cache for Gemini thought_signature values.
 *
 * Gemini thinking models include a `thought_signature` on functionCall parts
 * in their responses. This signature must be included when the functionCall
 * appears in subsequent request conversation history: the API rejects
 * requests where it is missing.
 *
 * The conversation state pipeline (normalizeMessagesForAPI) can strip custom
 * fields from content blocks, so we also cache signatures here keyed by
 * tool_use_id to guarantee they survive the round-trip.
