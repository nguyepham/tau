/**
 * Goal verification: a second opinion on the model's own completion claim.
 *
 * Self-report mode ends the loop when the model emits the completion marker,
 * which means the model grades itself. `--judge` puts one verification step
 * between the claim and the stop.
 *
 * Cost shape. The verifier is a fork of the LIVE conversation via
 * runForkedAgent, not a fresh agent handed a serialized transcript. That means:
 *   - the transcript is already in the fork's messages, so the prompt is the
 *     rubric alone (a few hundred tokens) rather than a re-serialization of the
 *     session;
 *   - the whole prefix is a cache READ against the main thread's entry.
 * It also means the fork must not override a single API parameter. Model,
 * thinking config, and max tokens are all part of the cache key, so "just use
 * Haiku for the judge" would cost a full uncached re-read of the session and be
 * far more expensive than inheriting the parent's model. See the warning in
 * promptSuggestion.ts (PR #18143: a fork-level effort override took the cache
 * hit rate from 92.7% to 61%).
 *
 * Fail-open by construction. Every failure path here returns null, and the
 * caller reads null as "no verdict" and honors the model's claim. A verifier
 * that is broken, rate-limited, or unparseable must never be able to trap the
 * loop; the worst case is exactly today's self-report behavior.
