/**
 * Attachment-block helpers shared by every lane whose wire format cannot
 * carry an Anthropic `image` / `document` block as-is.
 *
 * Two failure modes these exist to prevent:
 *
 *   1. `JSON.stringify(block)` on an image dumps its whole base64 payload
 *      into the prompt as plain text. A 20KB screenshot becomes ~27,000
 *      characters, roughly 10k tokens, replayed on every later turn, and
 *      carrying zero visual information: models cannot decode a compressed
 *      PNG from base64, so they answer from imagination instead.
 *   2. Skipping the block entirely leaves the `[Image #N]` marker in the
 *      user's text with nothing behind it, which produces the same
 *      confident fabrication with no clue that anything went missing.
 *
 * A short marker fixes both: the model is told an attachment exists and that
 * it did not arrive, so it says so instead of inventing.
 *
 * The marker is a pure function of the block (no clock, no network, no
 * config), so it serializes byte-identically on every replay and can never
 * shift an already-cached prompt prefix.
