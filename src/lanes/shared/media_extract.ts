/**
 * Attachment text extraction for lanes that cannot carry media natively.
 *
 * The problem: Devstral, Kimi, DeepSeek, Qwen and most other code models are
 * text-only, so a screenshot or a PDF reaches them as nothing at all. Marking
 * it "not sent" (see media_blocks.ts) at least stops the model inventing a
 * description, but the content is still lost.
 *
 * The fix: run the attachment through Mistral OCR once and feed the text in.
 *
 * Two-layer design, and the split matters:
 *
 *   1. `prefetchMediaText()` is async and runs ONCE per request, before the
 *      lane builds its payload. This is the only place that touches the
 *      network.
 *   2. `renderMediaForTextLane()` is sync, pure, and used inside the message
 *      converters. It only reads what layer 1 already resolved.
 *
 * Doing the OCR call inside the converter instead would put a network call in
 * the hot path of every turn AND make the serialized history non-deterministic,
 * which shifts the prompt-cache prefix and turns every turn into a cache miss.
 * Resolution is memoized by content hash and pinned for the process, so the
 * same attachment always renders the same bytes.
