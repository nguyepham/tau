/**
 * Shared compatibility for legacy "run this command in a directory" parameters
 * on lane-native shell tools.
 *
 * Background:
 * Earlier lane schemas exposed directory knobs (`workdir`, `dir_path`, `cwd`)
 * so models could recover from wrong-cwd commands. That fixed one class of
 * loop but zenght models to depend on a separate execution-directory field
 * instead of putting the target path in the command. The Bash/PowerShell
 * resolvers now auto-locate common targets and bake absolute paths/native CLI
 * location flags into the command string, so the model-facing schema should not
 * advertise a second directory control surface.
 *
 * The shared Bash/PowerShell impls already have a first-class `workdir`
 * field that is strictly better than a cd-prefix:
 *   - quoting-safe (no hand-quoting paths with spaces; on Windows the
 *     backslashes in a `cd "C:\…"` prefix are bash escapes),
 *   - one-off — it does NOT change the session cwd (a synthesized
 *     `cd X && …` is treated by BashTool as a real shell move and
 *     persists the cwd, which is a surprising side effect),
 *   - understood by the workdir preflight + the cwd-transparency note.
 *
 * Current contract:
 *   1. do NOT advertise a directory parameter in the schema the model sees;
 *      prompts should teach absolute paths or native CLI location flags instead.
 *   2. if an older provider shim still sends a directory key, map it to the
 *      shared impl's internal `workdir` field — never to a `cd …` prefix.
 *
 * Lanes keep their NATIVE parameter name (the model was post-trained on
 * it); only the mapping target is standardized. New lanes should reuse
 * the helpers here so the contract can't drift again. The cross-lane test
 * in shell_workdir.test.ts enforces it.
