- LARGE code files auto-skeleton: a whole-file Read (no offset/limit) of a supported code file (ts/js/py/go/rs/java/rb/cs/c/cpp/php and variants) above ~16KB returns the file's STRUCTURE — imports, signatures, and class shapes with long function bodies elided — instead of full content. Each elision marker shows the exact offset/limit Read call to expand that body, and line numbers are the file's real line numbers. Read specific ranges (offset/limit) for the bodies you need, pass skeleton: false to force full content, or skeleton: true to force a skeleton for any supported file. Unsupported files always return a normal read. Editing still requires a full-content Read of the relevant range first.

- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.`
