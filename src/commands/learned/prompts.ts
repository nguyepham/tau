A lesson is a **single concentrated bullet** capturing something **critical and general** — a reusable principle you would want to carry into the NEXT project (same stack/template or a different one). It must be worth interrupting the user to save.

Save things like:
- **Framework / library judgement** — e.g. when to reach for plain HTML vs a React component, server- vs client-rendering, a hook/lifecycle pitfall, an idiom that should be the default.
- **A whole class of bug and how to avoid it** — e.g. stale closures in effects, timezone/locale handling, off-by-one in pagination, unescaped braces in a config format.
- **Hard-won constraints or gotchas** of a tool, API, runtime, or environment.
- **Architecture / workflow principles** that clearly paid off.
- **User preferences** — how this user likes things done (style, tooling, process, how they want you to communicate).

Do NOT save: project-specific trivia, one-off fixes, routine implementation steps, anything obvious from reading the code, or a restatement of the task. When in doubt, save nothing — a junk lesson is worse than no lesson.

A good lesson is **portable**: no file paths, symbol names, or line numbers — phrase it as a general rule. Pick \`type\`: \`user\`/\`feedback\` for preferences, \`project\`/\`reference\` for technical principles.`;

## Task: show what I've learned
List every active lesson — the \`origin: learned\` files in the active memory dir — as concise bullet points (one per lesson, its general takeaway). These are what Zen actually uses. If there are none, say so.

Then check \`${stagingDir}\` for any leftover staged proposals from the old two-step flow. If any exist, list them separately under **Leftover proposals** and offer to either **activate** them (move the file into the active dir + add a \`MEMORY.md\` pointer) or **delete** them. If the dir is empty or missing, ignore it. Otherwise change nothing.

## Task: learn from this session
Reflect on the CURRENT conversation and extract only lessons that clear the bar below. If nothing clears it, say so plainly — that is the correct outcome most of the time; never invent a lesson to have one.

${LESSON_QUALITY_BAR}

For EACH candidate lesson, present it as a single concentrated bullet (a general principle) and use the **AskUserQuestion** tool with exactly these options — never more than 4:
- **Approve** — save it and use it from now on.
- **Edit wording** — let me reword it before saving.
- **Skip** — discard this one.

Handle ONE lesson per AskUserQuestion call (so options never exceed 4). For each approved (or edited) lesson, save it as a topic file in the active memory dir with frontmatter \`name\`, \`description\`, \`type\` (user/feedback/project/reference), \`origin: learned\`, \`learnedAt: <today's date, YYYY-MM-DD>\`, then the general takeaway as the body — AND add its one-line \`MEMORY.md\` pointer. It is active from the next session.

${SHARED_RULES}`,

  edit: () => `${header()}

## Task: edit a lesson
List the active lessons (\`origin: learned\` files) as a **numbered list**, one bullet each. Do NOT use the AskUserQuestion tool for this list — there may be more than 4 lessons, and AskUserQuestion is capped at 4 options. Ask the user to reply with the number (or name) of the lesson to edit. Then show its current content, apply the change they describe by rewriting that file, keep its \`MEMORY.md\` pointer in sync, and keep the result a concentrated, portable bullet that still clears the bar below.

  delete: () => `${header()}

## Task: delete a lesson
List the active lessons (\`origin: learned\` files) as a **numbered list**, one bullet each. Do NOT use the AskUserQuestion tool for this list — there may be more than 4 lessons, and AskUserQuestion is capped at 4 options. Ask the user which one(s) are not worth keeping. Confirm, then delete the file(s) AND remove their matching \`MEMORY.md\` pointer line(s).
