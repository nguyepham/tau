${parsedHint}

${SAFETY_RULES}

## Your task

Run these steps in order. Do NOT skip ahead. The whole point of the ordering is to avoid \`gh\` commands that will fail visibly — diagnose first, act only when safe.

### Step 1: Read the issue

1. Resolve the target repo:
   - URL target → use the \`<owner>/<repo>\` from the parsed hint above; pass \`--repo <owner>/<repo>\` on every \`gh\` call.
   - Number target → resolve current repo once: \`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner\`.
2. Fetch the issue:
   \`gh issue view <number> [--repo <owner/repo>] --json number,title,body,state,labels,assignees,author,comments\`
3. If \`state\` is \`CLOSED\`, tell the user the issue is already closed and STOP — do not relabel it.

### Step 2: Check write permission (silent)

Run exactly one check before touching any labels:
\`\`\`
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>" --jq '.permissions.push // false' 2>/dev/null || echo false
\`\`\`
- Output \`true\` → you have write access (author / collaborator / maintainer) → proceed to Step 3.
- Output \`false\` or empty → you do NOT have write access → SKIP Step 3 entirely and jump straight to Step 4. Do NOT attempt \`gh issue edit\`, \`gh label create\`, or any label-mutating call — they would fail and clutter the output.

### Step 3: Apply labels by category and criticality (only if Step 2 returned \`true\`)

1. List the repo's existing labels once: \`gh label list [--repo <owner/repo>] --limit 100 --json name --jq '.[].name'\`. Hold the set in memory.
2. From the issue body, decide which labels apply — only ones already in that set:
   - **Category** — \`bug\`, \`enhancement\`, \`documentation\`, \`question\`, or \`chore\`.
   - **Criticality** — only if labels like \`P0\`/\`P1\`/\`P2\`, \`high priority\`, \`critical\`, \`low priority\` exist in the set. Be conservative: \`high\`/\`critical\`/\`P0\` is reserved for broken core flows, security holes, or data loss.
   - **Status** — \`in progress\` if it exists.
3. Apply each chosen label with:
   \`gh issue edit <n> [--repo ...] --add-label "<name>" 2>/dev/null || true\`
   Do NOT create new labels. If a label you wanted is missing from the set, silently skip it.

### Step 4: Describe the issue (always — both URL and number paths)

Read every signal attached to the issue:
- Title, body, and every comment.
- Image attachments — extract URLs from \`![](url)\` and \`<img src="url">\` blocks. Use the URL VERBATIM (do not append a stray \`.\`, \`,\`, \`)\`, or any trailing punctuation that markdown rendering may have left behind). Fetch each image ONCE with \`WebFetch\`. If it 404s or times out, write "attachment unavailable" and move on — never retry the same URL.
- PDFs / file attachments linked in the body — same one-shot fetch rule.

If the issue body is *only* an image and that image is unreachable, reply: "Cannot describe the issue — the only attachment is unreachable. Please paste the error text or describe the screenshot." Then STOP. Do NOT speculate about the bug.

Otherwise, write a 2–4 sentence **Description** that captures: what the user is reporting, key error messages or screenshot contents, and any reproduction steps the issue mentions.

## Your task

1. Read the PR metadata: \`gh pr view <number> [--repo <owner/repo>] --json number,title,author,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,additions,deletions,changedFiles,labels,reviews,reviewRequests,statusCheckRollup,body\`.
2. Read the diff: \`gh pr diff <number> [--repo <owner/repo>]\`.
3. Read existing review comments and conversation: \`gh pr view <number> --comments\` and, if relevant, \`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments\`.
4. Audit:
   - **Tests:** were tests added or updated? Are they meaningful, or token boxes?
   - **Docs:** did public-facing behavior change without a doc / README / CHANGELOG update?
   - **Risk:** any new dependencies, schema migrations, security-sensitive code (auth, crypto, file IO, shell exec, eval), or breaking API changes?
   - **CI:** any failed required checks (\`statusCheckRollup\`)?
5. Reply with the **Good / Bad / Ugly** report:
   - **Good** — what is solid and ready to ship.
   - **Bad** — meaningful problems the author should fix before merge (missing tests, missing docs, regressions, unsafe patterns).
   - **Ugly** — nits, style, naming, dead code — clearly marked as optional.
   Cite \`file:line\` for every Bad / Ugly point. End with a one-line verdict: "approve / request-changes / comment".

DO NOT post the review to GitHub, do NOT \`gh pr review\`, do NOT comment on the PR. The user reads your report and decides.`

## Writing style — applies to every line of text you write

- Be specific about WHAT changed and WHY. Banned filler: "improved X", "refactored Y", "various updates", "minor changes", "this commit ...".
- Imperative voice for commit subjects ("Fix race in stream parser", not "Fixed" / "Fixing").
- Subject ≤60 chars. Add a body bullet ONLY if it tells a reader something the subject does not.
- Cut wordy phrases: "in order to" → "to", "make use of" → "use", "due to the fact that" → "because".
- No emojis, no celebration, no PR-style preamble, no "Generated with Claude" trailers.
- Plain English. A teammate reading the diff in six months should understand instantly.

## Issue link

${issueSection}

## Instructions

${instructionsSection}

## Your task

Run in this exact order. The four numbered phases (Stage+Commit → Changelog → Push) are the whole job. One push at the end carries both commits.

### Step 1: Survey

\`git status\`, \`git diff HEAD\`, \`git log --oneline -10\`. Understand what is staged and the repo's commit-message style so the new commit blends in.

If the working tree is clean and nothing is staged, tell the user "nothing to commit" and STOP.

### Step 2: Branch

Handle the branch section above. Never commit to \`main\` / \`master\` without explicit user confirmation in this turn.

### Step 3: Stage + commit the change (concentrated + high quality)

1. Stage only files relevant to this change. If anything looks like a secret (\`.env\`, \`*.pem\`, \`credentials.json\`, key-shaped strings), STOP and warn the user — do not stage.
2. Compose the message per **Writing style** above. Match repo style from Step 1's \`git log\`.
3. Commit with HEREDOC so multi-line bodies stay clean:
\`\`\`
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<subject>

- <why bullet 1>
- <why bullet 2>

Closes #N
EOF
)"
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Update changelog (concentrated + high quality, only if CHANGELOG.md exists)

1. If \`CHANGELOG.md\` does not exist at the repo root, SKIP this step — never create one.
2. Read it. Find or create the \`## [Unreleased]\` section at the top.
3. Append ONE concentrated bullet in user-facing terms (what the user gains, what bug is gone). If the change is purely internal with no user impact, SKIP and mark \`Changelog: skipped (no user-facing change)\` in the report — do not pad the file.
4. Match the file's existing entry style (Keep-a-Changelog past tense, plain bullets, whatever it uses).
5. Stage \`CHANGELOG.md\` and commit it as a SECOND commit with a concentrated repo-style message (e.g. \`Add changelog entry for <subject>\`). Do NOT amend the Step 3 commit.

### Step 5: Push to origin (most important — sends both commits at once)

1. \`git push -u origin <branch>\` — where \`<branch>\` is the branch from Step 2 (the one the user picked in the wizard).
2. If the push is rejected (non-fast-forward), STOP — do NOT force-push. Tell the user the remote moved and suggest \`git pull --rebase origin <branch>\` first.

### Step 6: Report

Reply with EXACTLY these lines, no other prose, no congratulations:

\`\`\`
Branch:    <name>
Commit:    <short SHA> <subject>
Changelog: updated (<short SHA>) | not present | skipped (no user-facing change)
Push:      ok
Issue:     #N | none
Next:      gh pr create --base <main> --head <branch> --title "<subject>"
\`\`\`

If any step failed, replace that line's value with \`failed: <one-line reason>\` and stop. Do not attempt recovery without asking.`

export function buildChangelogPrompt(args: string): string {
  const trimmed = args.trim()
  return `# /github changelog — audit & draft

${SAFETY_RULES}

## Your task

1. **Find the boundary**:
   - Latest tag: \`git describe --tags --abbrev=0\` (if no tags exist, fall back to the first commit on this branch).
   - HEAD: \`git rev-parse HEAD\`.
2. **Collect commits**: \`git log <last-tag>..HEAD --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an"\`. Skip merge commits (\`--no-merges\`).
3. **Read \`CHANGELOG.md\`** if it exists. Note the format (Keep-a-Changelog, conventional, plain bullets) so your draft matches.
4. **Categorize** every commit into:
   - **Added** — new features
   - **Changed** — enhancements to existing features
   - **Fixed** — bug fixes
   - **Removed** — removals
   - **Security** — security-relevant fixes
   - **Docs / Chore / Internal** — group at the bottom (or omit if the project's style does)
   Use commit messages, but if a subject is uninformative, run \`git show --stat <sha>\` and infer from the diff.
5. **Detect missing entries**: for each commit, check whether the existing \`CHANGELOG.md\` already mentions it. List any that were merged but never recorded.
6. **Draft the new section** for the next release. Use the project's existing format. Mark the version as \`[Unreleased]\` unless the user told you a target version${trimmed ? ` (they passed: \`${trimmed}\`)` : ''}.
7. **Reply** with:
   - The proposed new section (markdown, ready to paste).
   - A bullet list of "missed" commits that were merged but never made it into the changelog.
   - The question: "Write this to CHANGELOG.md now?" — STOP.

3. **Pull existing labels**: \`gh label list --limit 100 --json name,description,color\` — only apply labels that already exist. If a needed label is missing, ASK the user before creating it.
4. **For each issue**, classify:
   - **Type** — bug, enhancement, documentation, question, chore.
   - **Priority** — high (broken core flow / security / data loss), medium (degraded UX, blocking few users), low (cosmetic, nice-to-have). Be conservative on "high".
   - **Duplicate** — search older issues by title keywords (\`gh issue list --search "<keywords>" --state all\`). If you find a high-confidence duplicate, note it.
   - **Suggested assignee** — for code-related issues, run \`git log --pretty=format:"%an" -- <relevant-file> | head -10 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn\` to find the most recent contributor on the affected area. Suggest only — do NOT assign.
5. **Build a triage table** in markdown:
   | # | Title | Type | Priority | Action | Notes |
   Action is one of: \`label\`, \`close as duplicate of #N\`, \`needs info\`, \`assign to @user\` (suggestion only).
6. **Show the table to the user and STOP.** Then ask: "Apply these labels and close the duplicates? (yes / partial — give me numbers)".
7. **On user approval**, batch-apply with \`gh issue edit <n> --add-label "<label>"\` and \`gh issue close <n> --comment "Duplicate of #M"\` for the approved subset only. Print a one-line summary per change.

## What this command produces

The whole job of \`/github release\` is to produce four concentrated, high-quality artifacts:
1. **A new tag** — pushed to origin and marked as the green "Latest" release on GitHub.
2. **A release title** — a one-line theme summary, NOT just the bare version.
3. **A triggered workflow** — the release / deploy / publish workflow that auto-fires from the release, or one explicitly previewed before approval and then triggered.
4. **A quick description** — concentrated bullets covering everything that landed between the previous release tag and this one.

## Writing style — title, notes, report

Every line is **concentrated** (dense, no padding) and **high quality** (specific, user-facing). Banned filler: "improved X", "various updates", "this release ...", "miscellaneous changes". Plain English, no emojis, no celebration.

## Your task

### Step 1: Pre-flight

- \`git status\` — must be clean. If dirty, STOP.
- \`git branch --show-current\` — must be \`main\` / \`master\` (or the project's release branch). If not, ASK.
- \`git fetch --tags\` then \`git pull --ff-only\`. If non-fast-forward, STOP.
- Check release blockers: use \`gh run list --branch <branch> --limit 10 --json status,conclusion,workflowName,url\` and any repo-specific required check command. STOP if a required check is failing.

### Step 2: Find the boundary

- Last release tag: \`gh release view --json tagName -q .tagName 2>/dev/null || git describe --tags --abbrev=0\`.
- Resolve the new version (use user input above; otherwise compute the next bump).
- Discover the workflow artifact before the preview:
  - \`gh workflow list\` to find obvious release/deploy/publish workflows.
  - Inspect likely candidates with \`gh workflow view <workflow> --yaml\` if needed.
  - If a workflow clearly triggers on \`release\`, preview it as auto-triggered.
  - If one clear workflow supports \`workflow_dispatch\` but will not auto-trigger, preview it as a manual trigger after release creation.
  - If none or multiple ambiguous choices exist, preview \`none selected\`; do not guess.

### Step 3: Collect what's new since the last tag

- \`git log <last-tag>..HEAD --no-merges --pretty=format:"%H|%s"\`. For ambiguous subjects, run \`git show --stat <sha>\` to infer.
- Categorize each commit (Keep-a-Changelog headings):
  - **Added** — new features
  - **Changed** — enhancements to existing features
  - **Fixed** — bug fixes
  - **Removed** — deletions
  - **Security** — security-relevant fixes
- Combine related commits into ONE concentrated bullet. Skip pure tooling/internal noise unless it ships a user-facing benefit.

### Step 4: Preview and ASK (single confirmation gate)

Show the user EXACTLY this block, then ask "Publish?" — STOP and wait:

\`\`\`
Tag:      <version>          ← will be marked as the green "Latest" release on GitHub
Title:    <release title>    ← one-line theme of the release, NOT just the version
Workflow: <workflow plan>    ← auto-triggered by release | manual trigger after release | none selected
Notes:
  ## Added
  - <concentrated bullet>
  ## Changed
  - <concentrated bullet>
  ## Fixed
  - <concentrated bullet>
\`\`\`

The title summarizes the release theme in one line (e.g. \`v0.7.0 — Lane redesign + faster startup\`). If there is no clear theme, use \`<version> — <biggest change in one phrase>\`. Never just the bare version.

### Step 5: Publish (only on user approval)

Run in this exact order. STOP at the FIRST failure and surface the error verbatim:
1. **Changelog** — if \`CHANGELOG.md\` exists at repo root: move \`[Unreleased]\` content under \`## [<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>\`, leave a fresh empty \`[Unreleased]\` at the top. Stage + commit with a short repo-style message (e.g. \`Release <version>\`).
2. **Tag** — \`git tag -a <version> -m "<version> — <title>"\`.
3. **Push** — \`git push origin <branch>\` then \`git push origin <version>\`.
4. **GitHub release** — record the current UTC time, then create with the title and notes from Step 4:
\`\`\`
gh release create <version> --title "<title>" --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
<notes body>
EOF
)"
\`\`\`
Defaults to latest = the green "Latest" badge; do NOT pass \`--latest=false\` unless the user said so.

### Step 6: Triggered workflows

- If Step 4 previewed a manual workflow trigger, run it now with \`gh workflow run <workflow> --ref <version>\`. Do not trigger any workflow that was not previewed before approval.
- List runs that fired off the release or manual trigger: \`gh run list --limit 10 --json status,workflowName,url,createdAt,event,headBranch,headSha\`. Filter to runs created at or after the recorded release-create time and matching the previewed workflow plan.
- Capture every workflow-run URL for the report.

### Step 7: Report

Reply with EXACTLY this block, no other prose, no congratulations:

\`\`\`
Tag:        <version>  (Latest)
Title:      <title>
Release:    <gh release view URL>
Workflows:  <workflow1>: <run URL> · <workflow2>: <run URL>   |   none triggered
What's new since <last-tag>:
  - <Added bullet>
  - <Changed bullet>
  - <Fixed bullet>
\`\`\`

If anything failed AFTER the tag has been pushed, STOP and surface the error verbatim. Do NOT delete the tag without asking — that requires explicit user approval.`
